# Lucent

Weekly Objectives:

Today (Sunday):

Decide stack (FastAPI + Docker + Pytest)

Scaffold repo folders and files

Write a README with vision + planned architecture

Monday–Tuesday:

Implement FastAPI skeleton (/predict endpoint that takes an NCTID and returns hardcoded dummy data)

Add a service for fetching from ClinicalTrials.gov API (no real model yet)

Write 1–2 Pytest tests for /predict

Wednesday–Thursday:

Dockerize the app (single docker build, docker run gives you working API)

Update README with “How to run locally”

Friday–Saturday:

Polish code, refactor if needed

Push to GitHub, test fresh clone works

Write a “Next steps” section in README (model, frontend, etc.)

Sunday:

Review: can you send a link to a friend, they clone & run, see the endpoint work?

Plan following week’s sprint: real model integration, confidence metric, etc.
